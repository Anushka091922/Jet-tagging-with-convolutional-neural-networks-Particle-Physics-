### Overview
This repository serves as a resource for learning about jet tagging using deep neural networks in the context of high-energy physics, particularly proton-proton collisions. The project includes code, and datasets aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of the process of training and evaluating neural networks for jet classification tasks.
Machine learning, particularly deep learning, has sparked a revolution in the analysis of large-scale data samples within the field of particle physics, significantly enhancing the potential for discovering new fundamental laws of nature (Radovic et al., 2018). In particular, deep learning techniques have revolutionized the approach to jet tagging, a crucial classification task conducted at high-energy particle colliders like the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), resulting in a remarkable enhancement in performance (Kogler et al., 2019; Larkoski et al., 2020).

At the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), high-energy proton beams collide at an astounding frequency of 40 million times per second (40 MHz), producing sprays of outgoing particles. To analyze the resulting collision data, complex detector systems like ATLAS and CMS are employed, consisting of over 100 million individual sensors. These detectors measure various properties of the outgoing particles, allowing researchers to reconstruct collision events and identify novel physics processes, such as the discovery of the Higgs boson.
A crucial step in the analysis process is jet tagging, which involves identifying the type of particle that initiates a jet. Jets are collimated sprays of outgoing particles, and tagging them correctly is essential for distinguishing particles of interest, like the Higgs boson or the top quark, from other types of jets. However, jet tagging is challenging due to the radiation and subsequent particle production within jets, leading to a cascade of particles and smearing of the initial particle's characteristics.

Traditional jet tagging approaches rely on hand-crafted features based on the principles of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). However, the emergence of deep learning has introduced new methods that represent jets as unordered sets of outgoing particles. ParticleNet, for instance, adapts the Dynamic Graph CNN architecture and has shown substantial performance improvements on jet tagging benchmarks. Despite subsequent model proposals, no significant performance gains have been achieved, largely due to the lack of large public datasets.
